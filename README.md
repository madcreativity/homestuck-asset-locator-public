# Homestuck Asset Locator
A fanmade tool commissioned by OptimisticDuelist and JoyFulldreams.
The tool is meant to assist the Homestuck community with finding specific assets.

The Homestuck Asset Locator (HAL) uses <a href="https://electronjs.org/">Electron</a> as a compiler. Standard Electron files are not included in the Git repository and must be installed by those who wish to use it via Electron's own instructions.

This project also uses the 'googleapis' package. These files must also be required manually.
